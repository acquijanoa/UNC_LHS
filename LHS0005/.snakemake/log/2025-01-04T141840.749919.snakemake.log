Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule build_docker in file /Users/alvaroquijano/Documentos/Research/UNC_LHS/LHS0005/Snakefile, line 5:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
rstudio-project (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
